# Curated Vision Models for OCR/Structured Data Extraction Benchmarking

> **Generated:** 2026-02-11
> **Purpose:** Select top-performing vision models per price tier for receipt/invoice/document → JSON extraction benchmarking in ModelPick
> **Total models selected:** 24

## Methodology & Sources

Selection based on cross-referencing multiple sources:

1. **Fraunhofer IAIS Invoice Benchmark (2025)** — Benchmarked GPT-5, Gemini 2.5, and Gemma 3 families on 3 invoice datasets. Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved highest accuracy: 87.46% (scanned receipts), 96.50% (clean invoices), 92.71% (scanned invoices). Native image processing outperformed text-first approaches.
2. **Omni OCR Benchmark** — 1,000-document JSON extraction benchmark. Qwen 2.5 VL 72B & 32B achieved ~75% (matching GPT-4o). Gemma-3 27B surprisingly poor at 42.9%. Llama 4 Maverick later overtook Qwen as top open-source.
3. **Koncile Invoice Extraction Comparison (Aug 2025)** — GPT: 98% on text PDFs, Claude: 97%, Gemini: 96%. On scanned invoices: Gemini 94%, GPT 91%, Claude 90%.
4. **AIMultiple OCR Benchmark (2026)** — Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google Vision, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 tied for highest OCR accuracy scores.
5. **Roboflow GPT-5 Vision Evaluation (Aug 2025)** — GPT-5 tied for #1 on Vision Checkup with o4 Mini. Strong on document understanding/OCR.
6. **OmniDocBench 1.5 (Nov 2025)** — OCR Edit Distance: Gemini 3 Pro 81.4%, Gemini 2.5 Pro 69.6%, Claude Sonnet 4.5 68.5%, GPT-5.1 69.5%.
7. **Community reports (Reddit r/LocalLLaMA, r/Bard)** — Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving 98-99% on specific OCR tasks; Gemini 3 Flash scoring 100% on internal OCR benchmarks; Llama 4 Maverick reaching 95% accuracy.
8. **Mistral OCR 3 (Dec 2025)** — SOTA document parsing, double-digit accuracy lead over Azure AI and AWS Textract on handwriting/tables. (Note: Mistral OCR is a dedicated OCR API, not a general VLM on OpenRouter.)

### Structured Output (SO) Column Legend

> Verified via OpenRouter API `supported_parameters` field on 2026-02-11.

- **✅** = Full structured output (`response_format: { type: "json_schema" }`) — API enforces the JSON schema on the response, model CANNOT return malformed JSON
- **⚠️** = Partial support — either JSON mode only (valid JSON but no schema enforcement), or tool_use workaround only (no native `structured_outputs` parameter on OpenRouter)
- **❌** = No structured output support on OpenRouter (no `structured_outputs` or `response_format` parameter)

**Key insight:** 20 of 24 models support full structured output (✅). The main gaps are free-tier models (Gemma 3 12B, Nemotron Nano 12B) and older Anthropic models (Claude Sonnet 4, Opus 4) which predate Anthropic's structured output feature (Nov 2025). Sonnet 4 and Opus 4 still support `tools` which can be used as a workaround for schema-enforced extraction.

### Key Findings
- **Gemini family dominates OCR/document extraction** — 2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro, 3 Flash, and 3 Pro are all top-tier
- **Qwen VL models are the best open-source option** — Qwen 2.5 VL 72B matches GPT-4o; Qwen3 VL improves further
- **GPT-5 family is strong but not best-in-class for OCR** — Excellent reasoning helps, but Gemini has edge on visual text
- **Gemma 3 is surprisingly weak at OCR** — Despite similar architecture to Gemini 2.0, it scored only 42.9%
- **Claude excels at structured JSON output consistency** — Best format reliability, but slightly behind on raw OCR accuracy
- **Llama 4 Maverick is the open-source dark horse** — Overtook Qwen 2.5 VL as top open-source OCR model

## Key Caveats & Gotchas

1. **Gemma 3 is a trap** — Despite Gemini-derived architecture, it scores only 42.9% on OCR benchmarks. Test it to confirm, but don't expect competitive results.

2. **Claude Sonnet 4 "isn't great for document understanding"** — Reddit reports (May 2025) suggest it underperforms expectations. Sonnet 4.5 reportedly fixes this, but verify.

3. **Gemini Flash > Gemini Pro for OCR** — Counterintuitively, Flash models may be more accurate for pure OCR. Pro models' stronger reasoning can cause hallucinations ("over-thinking" simple text).

4. **GPT-5.2 exists but is expensive** — At $1.75 input, it's only marginally better than GPT-5.1 at $1.25. Not worth a separate test slot unless budget allows.

5. **Qwen models lack PDF support** — Despite being excellent at OCR from images, none of the Qwen VL models support PDF input natively. You'll need to convert PDFs to images first.

6. **Open-source models via OpenRouter** — Performance may vary slightly from self-hosted due to quantization differences on OpenRouter's inference providers.

7. **Mistral OCR ≠ Mistral Small/Medium** — Mistral's dedicated OCR API is excellent but is a different product from their general VLMs on OpenRouter. The general VLMs (Small 3.1, Medium 3) are decent but not OCR-specialized.

8. **Context window matters for multi-page** — Gemini (1M tokens) and GPT-5 (400K) can handle very long documents. Qwen models have shorter contexts (16K-32K for some variants).

9. **Claude Sonnet 4 & Opus 4 lack native structured output on OpenRouter** — These models predate Anthropic's structured output feature (Nov 2025). They support `tools` (which can enforce schema via tool_use trick), but not `response_format: { type: "json_schema" }`. The newer Claude models (Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.6) all have full structured output support.

10. **Free-tier models have reduced OpenRouter features** — Even models that support structured output in their paid variant (e.g., Gemma 3 27B) may lose that support in the `:free` variant on OpenRouter. The free Gemma 3 27B has `response_format` (JSON mode) but not `structured_outputs` (schema enforcement).

## Dark Horses to Watch 🏇

| Model | Why It's Interesting |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Llama 4 Maverick** ($0.15) | Overtook Qwen as top open-source OCR. Huge value at this price. |
| **Gemini 2.0 Flash** ($0.10) | Community reports 98-99% accuracy. May outperform models 10-20x its price. |
| **Qwen3 VL 235B A22B** ($0.20) | MoE keeps cost absurdly low for a 235B model. Qwen3 family claims 97% DocVQA. |
| **GPT-5 Nano** ($0.05) | If it inherits GPT-5's vision strength, it could be the ultimate budget pick. |
| **NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 12B** (Free) | Untested dark horse. NVIDIA's VLM entry — could surprise. |
